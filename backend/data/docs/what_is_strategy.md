# What Is Strategy?

Strategy predates management science. Ancient military texts such as Sun Tzu's *The Art of War* and Kautilya's *Arthashastra* described strategy as the deliberate alignment of limited resources with decisive objectives. Industrial-era leaders revived those principles when railroads and steel magnates needed coherent plans for sprawling enterprises. Alfred Sloan's decentralized structure at General Motors exemplified modern strategy: decide where to play, how to win, and which trade-offs to embrace so the portfolio stays coherent. Strategy, in other words, is as much about refusing tempting distractions as it is about bold ambition.

Contemporary strategists stretch their view across multiple horizons. They watch structural forces—technology, regulation, demographics—and translate them into concrete plays for product, go-to-market, and operations teams. Valuable strategies are falsifiable: they spell out assumptions, leading indicators, and clear evidence thresholds. When AI enters the workflow, that rigor becomes indispensable because models can amplify weak assumptions. Grounding every recommendation in traceable evidence keeps strategic debates anchored to facts.

Execution discipline completes the loop. A smart deck matters only if teams can inspect the logic, test hypotheses, and adjust course without losing institutional memory. This is why our intelligence system insists on provenance-aware retrieval chunks; each decision in the control graph cites a specific source snippet, letting the next strategist understand why a move seemed sound—or not—when it was made.
